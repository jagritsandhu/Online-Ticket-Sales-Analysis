# Online_Ticket_Sales_Analysis
In this project, I will be accessing data stored in Amazon Redshift, a data warehouse product that is part of Amazon Web Services. More specifically, I'll be analyzing sales activity from a fictional ticketing website where users both buy and sell tickets online for sporting events, shows, and concerts 

## Aim of The Project
Which users should we target for our advertising purposes?
- There are several users, who have advertised or have put tickets up for sale but haven't been able to sell them effectively. 
- By recognizing these users, we can specifically target them through advertizing. 

## Tech Stack
- I'll be using SQL to query the Redshift database as well as to manipulate the data.
- I'll also use Python to visualize this data na dform interesting conclusions.
